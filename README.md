# (WIP) Variable Topology General Use Multithreaded Neural Network

Much of this project is still under heavy development. Currently not even at a useable state.
The overall plan is to have a general use Neural Net framework which will only require the creation of input and output neuron classes in order to be used.

## TODO
Node.h

	- Figure out some kind of thread management because the current method is not very practical

	- Update interface given the changes to the layer class and the treeNode class
NeuralNetLayer.h

main.cpp

	- Everything needed to run the neural net
TreeNode.cpp

NeuralNet.h
