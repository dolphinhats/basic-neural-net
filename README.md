# (WIP) Variable Topology General Use Multithreaded Neural Network

Much of this project is still under heavy development. Currently not even at a useable state.
The overall plan is to have a general use Neural Net framework which will only require the creation of input and output neuron classes in order to be used.

# TODO

Node.h
	- update


NeuralNetLayer.h


main.cpp
	- odo everything
